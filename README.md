# Livepeer Community Transcoder Node's Grant Program

Livepeer is seven months into main net launch, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of participation from the developer community. Livepeer has a long term vision to build a fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. We’re excited to launch the Community Grant Program, which provides developers with grants ranging from 300 - 3000 LPT (subject to change). Grant program provides developers with an opportunity to build a position in the network early on. 

If you're appreciative of this initiative and all that it will do for the ecosystem, bond to our transcoder node, and contribute a portion of your inflationary reward to go towards these grants! *Node address: 0x4f4758f7167b18e1f5b3c1a7575e3eb584894dbc*

**Grant Amount Range:** 300-3000 LPT

**We are seeking projects and will provide funding for:**
* Data analytics: How do we gain visibility into the economics of the network? Supermax.cool/livepeer is an example of a dashboard built, but its not that easy to parse and others could build alternate dashboards with new features. 
* Applications that make it easier for token holders to bond token. This could be a new staking application similar to the explorer (needed! See grant) This could be a custom wallet similar to the TezBox and Galleon wallets specific to the Tezos network. 
* Applications, alerts or automations that make it easier for token holders to hold their transcoder accountable. 
Translation + sharing: Translating the new streamflow paper and sharing it with five communities in your network
