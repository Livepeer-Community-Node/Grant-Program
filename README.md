Livepeer Community Transcoder Node's Grant Program

Livepeer is seven months into main net launch, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of participation from the developer community. Livepeer has a long term vision to build a fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. We’re excited to launch the Community Grant Program, which provides developers with grants ranging from 300 - 3000 LPT (subject to change). Grant program provides developers with an opportunity to build a position in the network early on. 

Amount: 300-3000 LPT

We are seeking projects and will provide funding for: 
Data analytics: How do we gain visibility into the economics of the network? Supermax.cool/livepeer is an example of a dashboard built, but its not that easy to parse and others could build alternate dashboards with new features. 
Applications that make it easier for token holders to bond token. This could be a new staking application similar to the explorer (needed! See grant) This could be a custom wallet similar to the TezBox and Galleon wallets specific to the Tezos network. 
Applications, alerts or automations that make it easier for token holders to hold their transcoder accountable. 
Translation + sharing: Translating the new streamflow paper and sharing it with five communities in your network 

Requirements
Projects must be open source 
We are open to funding projects built by teams or individuals, although it helps to have both product/UX + backend for the apps. You can find individuals to join you and collaborate by joining Discord and posting in the #Hacker channel
